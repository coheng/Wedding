http://coheng.github.io/wedding.html

1. Applying my very basic HTML & CSS skills to design my wedding inivtation. 

2. Started off with a basic Foundation template and built it up from there. 
3. Used basic HTML (normally use Jade and compile into HTML) and minified my css before deploying. 

4. Found a piece of PHP that I wangled to send through RSVPs to a dedicated mailbox
5. My Responsive implementation seems like quite a shlep but it works on the desired devices
